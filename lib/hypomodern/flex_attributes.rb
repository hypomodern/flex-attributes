module Hypomodern # :nodoc:

  # Flex attributes allow for the common but questionable database design of
  # storing attributes in a thin key/value table related to some model.
  #
  # = Rationale for an update
  # 
  # This is an update to Eric Anderson's original flex_attributes plugin. It makes
  # few real changes, just bugfixes and tightening up the code here and there.
  # That said, there is one HUGE change here and that is this:
  # Your flex attributes are all treated as value-objects. This means that if
  # you want to write one, you'd best write everything that you want to persist.
  #
  # The reasoning for this has to do with Rails' SQL generation post 2.0. It was
  # blindly issuing SQL to "UPDATE *_attributes SET value = 'my_value'". That's it.
  # No qualification, no scoping. I tried disabling the partial updates feature,
  # but no dice. No sweat though, since I had actually kind of wanted this new
  # behavior all along.
  #
  # = Capabilities
  #
  # The FlexAttributes plugin is capable of modeling this problem in a intuitive
  # way. Instead of having to deal with a related model you treat all attributes
  # (both on the model and related) as if they are all on the model. The plugin
  # will try to save all attributes to the model (normal ActiveRecord behaviour)
  # but if there is no column for an attribute it will try to save it to a
  # related model whose purpose is to store these many sparsly populated
  # attributes.
  #
  # The main design goals are:
  #
  # * Have the flex attributes feel like normal attributes. Simple gets and sets
  #   will add and remove records from the related model.
  # * Allow a model to determine what a valid flex attribute is for a given
  #   related model so our model still can generate a NoMethodError.
  module FlexAttributes
    def self.included(base) # :nodoc:
        base.extend ClassMethods
    end

    module ClassMethods

      # Will make the current class have flex attributes.
      #
      #   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      #     has_flex_attributes
      #   end
      #   eric = User.find_by_login 'eric'
      #   puts "My AOL instant message name is: #{eric.aim}"
      #   eric.phone = '555-123-4567'
      #   eric.save
      #
      # The above example should work even though "aim" and "phone" are not
      # attributes on the User model.
      #
      # The following options are available on for has_flex_attributes to modify
      # the behavior. Reasonable defaults are provided:
      #
      # class_name::
      #   The class for the related model. This defaults to the
      #   model name prepended to "Attribute". So for a "User" model the class
      #   name would be "UserAttribute". The class can actually exist (in that
      #   case the model file will be loaded through Rails dependency system) or
      #   if it does not exist a basic model will be dynamically defined for you.
      #   This allows you to implement custom methods on the related class by
      #   simply defining the class manually.
      # table_name::
      #   The table for the related model. This defaults to the
      #   attribute model's table name.
      # relationship_name::
      #   This is the name of the actual has_many
      #   relationship. Most of the type this relationship will only be used
      #   indirectly but it is there if the user wants more raw access. This
      #   defaults to the class name underscored then pluralized finally turned
      #   into a symbol.
      # foreign_key::
      #   The key in the attribute table to relate back to the
      #   model. This defaults to the model name underscored prepended to "_id"
      # name_field::
      #   The field which stores the name of the attribute in the related object
      # value_field::
      #   The field that stores the value in the related object
      # versioned::
      #   If the model you are storing these attributes on is versioned, then set
      #   this to ensure that your attributes will persist! Otherwise, they will
      #   all be torn down per save. N.B. the attributes are not versioned into
      #   a separate table, as they were with the old system. That's way too much
      #   overhead :).
      # version_column::
      #   Set this if the column you're using to store your version information
      #   isn't "version".
      # fields::
      #   A list of fields that are valid flex attributes. By default
      #   this is "nil" which means that all field are valid. Use this option if
      #   you want some fields to go to one flex attribute model while other
      #   fields will go to another. As an alternative you can override the
      #   #flex_attributes method which will return a list of all valid flex
      #   attributes. This is useful if you want to read the list of attributes
      #   from another source to keep your code DRY. The following
      #   provides an example:
      #
      #  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
      #    has_flex_attributes :class_name => 'Preferences'
      #
      #    def flex_attributes
      #      %w(project_search project_order user_search user_order)
      #    end
      #  end
      #
      #  eric = User.find_by_login 'eric'
      #  eric.project_order = 'name'     # Will save to Preferences
      #  eric.save # Carries out save so now values are in database
      #
      # If both a :fields option and #flex_attributes method is defined the
      # :fields option take precidence. This allows you to easily define the
      # field list inline for one model while implementing #flex_attributes
      # for another model and not having #flex_attributes need to determine
      # what model it is answering for. In both cases the list of flex
      # attributes can be a list of string or symbols
      #
      # The final and perhaps best alternative is the #is_flex_attribute?
      # method. This method is given the name of the attribute
      # in question. If you override this method then the #flex_attributes
      # method or the :fields option will have no affect. Use of this method
      # is ideal when you want to retrict the attributes but do so in a
      # algorithmic way.
      #
